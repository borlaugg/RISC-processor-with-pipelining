# RISC-pipelinee-processor
This is a repository containg code for a 6 staged pipelined processor.

Developed during the Spring 2022 Microprocessor course at IITB, this project is an implementation of a pipelined MIPS processor featuring hazard detection, branch prediction as well as forwarding. This implementation is based on a limited ISA, the details for which are present in MIPS_ISA.png. This code is synthesizable and can be run. I used Quartus for testing purposes. The components have been individually tested but not as a unit due to the large number of i/o pins required for synthesis.

The problem statement is available as a pdf in .pdf
